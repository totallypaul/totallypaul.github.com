  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>I remember when Dan, my older brother, sat at the table pointing at his glass of milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think this is half full,&#8221; he said with the kind of authority only an older, smarter brother can muster, &#8220;You&#8217;re an optimist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But!&#8221; he said with a dramatic flair, sweeping his arm towards the glass. &#8220;If you think it&#8217;s half empty, well, then you are a pessimist.&#8221; He smirked as if he had just figured out the theory of relatives or whatever Einstein figured out.</p>

<p>I nodded at him, and he seem satisfied that I caught on. But I didn&#8217;t. I mean, after all it was just a glass of milk. If it&#8217;s half full or half empty you can always get more. We always had milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if its water?&#8221; I finally asked as he drank the milk. He almost choked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still the same!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean it turns into milk?&#8221; I asked, a little more confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; he shook his head. &#8220;Water is water, milk is milk, and it just depends on how much is in your glass and how full you think it is.&#8221;</p></td>
