  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&#8220;We are going to Marvin&#8217;s in-laws for Thanksgiving,&#8221; my wife informed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which ones are those?. I asked, trying not to let the disappointment show in my face, or my voice or in my body language.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember his brother&#8217;s wife&#8217;s aunt that makes those gelatin sculptures?&#8221;</p>

<p>I grimaced and spoke slowly as the painful memory came back. &#8220;That old woman with no eyebrows who dyes her hair kind of red streaked-black?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, that&#8217;s her. At her sister&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one that thinks there&#8217;s still gold lost in the Red Sea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; My wife sighed as she walked away, leaving me with my thoughts. I tried to think of different schemes to get out of going, but once again, I failed to come up with anything. In fact, like I tend to do with lots of distasteful ideas, I completely forgot about it.</p></td>
