  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p>I mowed my lawn again today. Sometimes when I mow I get into an almost trancelike state where I meditate and solve problems. I don.t know why. I guess it.s the feeling of power I have when I.m pushing that three and half horse power engine around the yard sending huge amounts of grass, weeds, flowers, clothespins, toys, and bugs flying in all directions. Usually back into my face.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, mowing has been a time for me to be by myself and meditate since I was a young boy. I would go out and mow my third of the lawn (I have two brothers) and think great thoughts.</p>

<p>For example, it was when mowing that I figured out how to make my third look bigger and yet be smaller than the other thirds, or how to give deceptive perception to yard space.</p>

<p>I also learned that if a choke sticks on a lawn mower engine you can put a twig in it to hold it open. That worked very well until the fire.</p>

<p>That was before video cameras. Otherwise you.d have seen me jumping around a burning lawnmower, pulling off my shirt and beating a poor defenseless mower into submission with it. I really liked that shirt.</p></td>
