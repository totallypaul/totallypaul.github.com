  <h2>About ol' Paul</h2>
<p>Although Paul raised himself up from his humble beginnings, you have to remember, it was only his <em>beginnings</em> that were humble. On the other hand, <em>he</em> was not. He has always had a very careful way of looking at things. I remember one time, I asked him to read a story I had written.</p>

<p>I asked him what he thought. He succinctly said, "well, you know. I never, you know, lost interest." And there you have it. Hearty praise from a man who knows how to wear a cowboy hat, play a guitar and host squirrels in the engine of his truck.</p>

<p>But I think his personality is best characterized by his relationships with those he loves and those who love him.</p>

  <h2>About this Fansite</h2>
<p>This is totally a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansite"> Fansite</a> for TotallyPaul simply because he's... well, <em>totally</em> Paul! You can't get much more cooler than that. Unless of course, you're his brother. Right, Tim?
