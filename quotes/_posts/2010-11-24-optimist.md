I remember when Dan, my older brother, sat at the table pointing at his glass of milk.

"If you think this is half full," he said with the kind of authority only an older, smarter brother can muster, "You're an optimist."

"But!"  he said with a dramatic flair, sweeping his arm towards the glass. "If you think it's half empty, well, then you are a pessimist."  He smirked as if he had just figured out the theory of relatives or whatever Einstein figured out.

I nodded at him, and he seem satisfied that I caught on. But I didn't. I mean, after all it was just a glass of milk. If it's half full or half empty you can always get more. We always had milk.

"What if its water?" I finally asked as he drank the milk. He almost choked.

"It's still the same!"

"You mean it turns into milk?" I asked, a little more confused.

"No, no, no!" he shook his head.  "Water is water, milk is milk, and it just depends on how much is in your glass and how full you think it is."
