"We are going to Marvin's in-laws for Thanksgiving," my wife informed me.

"Which ones are those?. I asked, trying not to let the disappointment show in my face, or my voice or in my body language."

"You remember his brother's wife's aunt that makes those gelatin sculptures?"

I grimaced and spoke slowly as the painful memory came back. "That old woman with no eyebrows who dyes her hair kind of red streaked-black?"

"Yes, yes, that's her. At her sister's house."

"The one that thinks there's still gold lost in the Red Sea?"

"Yes!" My wife sighed as she walked away, leaving me with my thoughts. I tried to think of different schemes to get out of going, but once again, I failed to come up with anything. In fact, like I tend to do with lots of distasteful ideas, I completely forgot about it.
